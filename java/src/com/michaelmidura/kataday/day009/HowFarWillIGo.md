<b>Description:</b>

You have recently discovered thar horses travel in a unique pattern - they're either running (at top speed) or resting (standing still).

Here's an example of how one particular horse might travel:

<pre><code>The horse Blaze can run at 14 metres/second for 60 seconds, but must then rest for 45 seconds.

After 500 seconds Blaze will have traveled 4200 metres.</code></pre>

Your job is to write a function that returns how long a horse will have traveled after a given time.

<b>Input:</b>

* totalTime - How long the horse will be traveling (in seconds)
* runTime - How long the horse can run for before having to rest (in seconds)
* restTime - How long the horse have to rest for after running (in seconds)
* speed - The max speed of the horse (in metres/second)
