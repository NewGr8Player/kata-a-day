<b>Description:</b>

Punky loves wearing different colored socks, but Henry can't stand it.

Given an array of different colored socks, return a pair depending on who was picking them out.

Example:

<pre><code>getSocks("Punky", ["red","blue","blue","green"]) -> ["red", "blue"]</code></pre>

Note that Punky can have any two colored socks, in any order, as long as they are different and both exist. Henry always picks a matching pair.

If there is no possible combination of socks, return an empty array.
